These are the design for the desktop and moblie view signup and login pages where the user can create only one account with one email id .This will be checked at the time of signup .The user will be entering the name,email id and the password . This will be sent to the database .If the email is already registerd alert message will be sent that only one account created by one email id (i.e. Account already exists)
similarly for login .At the time of login the email id entered should be already present in the databse and also the password should match with the entered password .If anyone of the creteria is not followed the user will get the alert message as (invalid username or password)
